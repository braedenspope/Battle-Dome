# Overview

This Program is a basic battle simulator, giving the user options for creating a character, and then battle a randomly generated opponent. They may attack, defend, or heal during each turn, while their opponent may do the same.

I created this program for the purpose of expanding on my current knowledge and understanding of the C++ language, and to make a simple game I could enjoy by myself if I ever get bored.
